This is an example of a cocoon code. We use this for development cocoon code. This is like a playground for
to test various cocoon funtionalities.

Run:
```sh
env COCOON_CODE_PORT=8003 go run main.go
```

Setting the `COCOON_CODE_PORT` forces a connector to connect to the local cocoon code as opposed to fetching, building and running a remotely hosted cocoon code.
